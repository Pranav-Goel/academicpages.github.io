I am a budding Computer Scientist excited by research lying at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I recently finished my first year as a **Ph.D.** student at the [**University of Maryland**](https://www.umd.edu/) in the [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/pgoel1) program doing **NLP** research at the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing ([**CLIP**](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)) lab. I finished my Bachelors in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) from [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2018.

My undergraduate advisor at IIT (BHU) Varanasi was [Prof. Anil Kumar Singh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/aksinghcse), with whom I explored sentiment and emotion anaylsis, and story ending prediction among a host of other topics. I also worked as a research intern with [Dr. Aditya Joshi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~adityaj/) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) at the [CFILT Lab](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/), Indian Insitute of Technology Bombay on computational sarcasm in summer 2016, as a software engineering intern with the Data Science team of [Ephesoft, India](https://www.ephesoft.com/) on content analysis in winter 2016, and as a research intern with [Dr. Yoichi Matsuyama](http://www.yoichimatsuyama.com/) and [Prof. Justine Cassell](http://www.justinecassell.com/) at the [Articulab](http://articulab.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University on conversational strategy identification (as a component of an embodied conversational agent) in summer 2017. I worked on conversational agents and chatbots with [Nebojsa Jojic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jojic/) in the NLP research group at Micrsoft Research, Redmond in summer 2019. **I am currently working on Computational Political Science with [Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/).**

I am lucky to have worked with many amazing people on extremely interesting topics and I look forward to exploring more!

I grew up in [New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi), India.
