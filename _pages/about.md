I am a budding Computer Scientist excited by research lying at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am a currently a first year PhD in Computer Science student at [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/) in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/pgoel1) program. I recently finished my Bachelors in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) from [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). 

My undergraduate advisor at IIT (BHU) Varanasi was [Prof. Anil Kumar Singh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/aksinghcse), with whom I explored sentiment and emotion anaylsis, and story ending prediction among a host of other topics. I also worked as a research intern with [Dr. Aditya Joshi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~adityaj/) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) at the [CFILT Lab](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/), Indian Insitute of Technology Bombay on computational sarcasm in summer 2016, as a software engineering intern with the Data Science team of [Ephesoft, India](https://www.ephesoft.com/) on content analysis in winter 2016, and as a research intern with [Dr. Yoichi Matsuyama](http://www.yoichimatsuyama.com/) and [Prof. Justine Cassell](http://www.justinecassell.com/) at the [Articulab](http://articulab.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University on conversational strategy identification (as a component of an embodied conversational agent) in summer 2017. 

I am lucky to have worked with many amazing people on extremely interesting topics. I look forward to exploring more as a doctoral student now! 

I grew up in [New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi), India.
